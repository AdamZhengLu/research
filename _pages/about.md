His current research focus is on the applications of integrated process-based hydrologic models and remote sensing approaches to describe groundwater-surface water interactions and the associated processes, especially changes in land surface processes, and assessing their possible impacts on the eco-hydrology over the Heihe River Basin of China as well as other arid and semi-arid regions.

He has published 30+ papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SCHOLAR_ID&user=Y59A2dsAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>400+</span></strong></a> (<a href='[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SCHOLAR_ID&user=Y59A2dsAAAAJ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SCHOLAR_ID&user=Y59A2dsAAAAJ)'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
